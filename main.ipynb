The process starts by exploring and cleaning the dataset to understand customer behavior and identify key variables related to churn. Next, we apply feature engineering and build several machine learning classification models, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM to predict whether a customer will churn or stay. We benchmark these models using cross validation and various performance metrics to find the best balance between accuracy, recall, and interpretability. After selecting the most suitable model, we evaluate it on unseen test data and interpret the results to generate insights that can support the company’s customer retention strategy."

    "The visualizations show clear patterns related to customer churn. From the tenure histograms and boxplots, we can see that customers who churn usually have much shorter tenure—many of them leave within the first few months. In contrast, customers who stay tend to have been with the company much longer, especially those above 60 months. This makes tenure a strong indicator of churn risk. Meanwhile, the monthly charges plots show that churned customers generally pay higher monthly fees compared to those who stay. Their distribution is centered around the higher price range, and the boxplot confirms that churners have a higher median charge. Overall, the plots indicate that newer customers and those paying higher monthly bills are more likely to churn, while long-term customers with lower charges tend to stay loyal."

    "The barplots and tables show how different service features relate to customer churn. For several features like OnlineSecurity, OnlineBackup, DeviceProtection, and TechSupport, the pattern is consistent: customers who do not use these services have a much higher churn rate. For example, customers without OnlineSecurity have about 42% churn, while those who have it churn only around 15%. A similar trend appears for OnlineBackup and DeviceProtection—people who subscribe to these add-on services are less likely to leave. Customers who don’t use internet service at all have the lowest churn overall, which makes sense because they usually subscribe to fewer services and have simpler plans.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Internet service type also plays a big role. Fiber optic users have the highest churn rate at around 42%, while DSL users churn less (about 18%). This suggests that fiber optic customers—who usually pay more—might be more sensitive to pricing or performance issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The strongest churn indicator is the Contract type. Month-to-month contracts have a very high churn rate (about 43%), while one-year and two-year contracts show dramatically lower churn (around 10% and 2%). This clearly shows that longer contracts lock customers in and improve retention.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lastly, customers who use PaperlessBilling churn more often than those who receive paper bills. Paperless billing users have about 33% churn, compared to only 16% for non-paperless users. This might reflect that digital-savvy customers switch providers more easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the charts and tables highlight a clear story: customers with fewer services, higher flexibility (like month-to-month contracts), or higher-cost services tend to churn more, while customers with bundled services and longer commitments are much more likely to stay."

It also adds the total number of customers in each service category. After that, the table is sorted by the churn rate so we can easily see which internet service type has the highest percentage of churn. This helps us understand how churn varies across different service types."

    "From the evaluation metrics without oversampling, the model shows a clear gap between the performance on the training data and the validation data. The training metrics (accuracy, ROC-AUC, F1, recall, and precision) are noticeably higher than the validation metrics, which suggests that the model may be slightly overfitting to the original imbalanced dataset. Because the minority class (churn) is underrepresented, the model struggles to detect churn correctly, leading to lower recall on the test folds. In other words, the model performs well on majority-class customers but has trouble recognizing churners.\n",
    "When oversampling is applied, the evaluation metrics improve, especially recall. The recall on the validation set becomes significantly higher compared to the model without oversampling, meaning the model is now better at catching churners. This is important because recall is a key metric in churn prediction—missing a real churner is more costly than incorrectly predicting churn. The F1 score and ROC-AUC on the validation set also improve or stay more consistent, showing that oversampling helps balance the model’s ability to detect both classes. Overall, oversampling makes the model more stable and more effective at identifying at-risk customers, without causing severe overfitting."

    "The classification reports show that the model performs very well for class 0 (non-churn), but has more difficulty with class 1 (churn). For the non-churn class, the model reaches a high precision of around 0.90, meaning most of the customers predicted as non-churn are actually correct. The recall for this class sits around 0.75–0.77, which means the model is able to correctly identify most non-churn customers.\n",
    "For the churn class, the model behaves differently. Precision is lower, around 0.53–0.55, which means that when the model predicts a customer will churn, it's only right about half the time. However, recall for churn is quite strong at 0.77, meaning the model successfully catches a large portion of actual churners. This is important in churn prediction because missing a churner is usually more costly than a false alarm.\n",
    "Overall accuracy sits around 0.76–0.77, but accuracy alone doesn’t tell the full story due to class imbalance. The macro and weighted averages show that the model is reasonably balanced, but still performs better on the majority class. The key takeaway is: the model is good at detecting churners (high recall), although it sacrifices some precision, which is often acceptable for churn prevention, where catching as many at-risk customers as possible is the priority."

    "We use LightGBM because it’s one of the fastest and most powerful models for tabular data like this. It handles large datasets, mixed feature types, and complex patterns really well without requiring heavy preprocessing. LightGBM is also great at dealing with imbalanced data, especially when we add class_weight='balanced', which makes it better at detecting churners — the minority class.\n",
    "Compared to simpler models like logistic regression or decision trees, LightGBM can capture deeper relationships between features, and compared to XGBoost, it usually trains faster while giving similar or even better performance. Overall, LightGBM gives us high accuracy, strong recall for churn prediction, and clear feature importance using SHAP, making it a solid choice for this problem."

    "This SHAP barplot shows which features contribute the most to the model’s predictions, expressed in percentages. The Contract feature stands out as the most influential by a wide margin, meaning the type of contract a customer has plays the biggest role in predicting whether they churn or stay. Next comes tenure, which makes sense because customers who have been with the company longer are less likely to leave. MonthlyCharges is also a major factor, showing that higher or lower monthly fees strongly affect churn behavior.\n",
    "After the top three, the influence becomes smaller but still meaningful. Features like PaperlessBilling, OnlineSecurity, InternetService (Fiber optic), and TechSupport all contribute to the model’s predictions, though not as strongly as the main factors. These smaller contributions capture patterns such as customers without security or support services being more likely to churn.\n",
    "Overall, the plot tells us that churn is mainly driven by contract length, how long the customer has been with the company, and how much they pay each month, while service-related features add supporting information for the model."

    "The SHAP summary plot shows how each feature affects the model’s prediction for churn, both in terms of impact and direction. At the top, Contract clearly has the strongest influence, meaning the type of contract a customer has is the biggest factor in determining whether they churn. The plot shows that lower contract values (like month-to-month, shown in red) push the model strongly toward predicting churn, while higher contract values (one-year or two-year contracts, shown in blue) push the prediction toward not churn. This aligns perfectly with what we saw in the EDA.\n",
    "Right after Contract, tenure is another major factor. Customers with short tenure (blue dots) push the model toward churn, while customers with longer tenure (red dots) make the model predict they will stay. This makes sense — new customers tend to churn more easily than those who’ve been loyal for years.\n",
    "MonthlyCharges also plays a big role. Higher monthly charges (red) often push predictions toward churn, showing that customers paying more are more likely to leave. This supports the earlier observation that high-cost customers feel more pressure to switch providers.\n",
    "The next set of features — PaperlessBilling, OnlineSecurity, Fiber optic service, TechSupport, OnlineBackup, and DeviceProtection — have smaller but still meaningful impacts. Generally, not having these services (often shown as “_0”) increases churn risk. For example, customers without OnlineSecurity or TechSupport often contribute positively to the churn prediction. The plot also shows that Fiber optic users lean more toward churn compared to DSL customers.\n"

    "The confusion matrix shows how well the LightGBM model classified churn and non-churn customers. The top left number (643) represents customers who actually did not churn and were correctly predicted as non churn, which shows really good prediction. On the top right, there are 80 customers who didn’t churn but the model mistakenly predicted they would.\n",
    "On the bottom left, we have 132 actual churners that the model failed to detect (false negatives). These are the customers the company should have caught but didn’t ideally this number should be lower. Lastly, the bottom right value (131) shows the churn customers that were correctly identified.\n",
    "Overall, the model does very well at identifying non churn customers, and it catches a decent amount of churners too, although there's still room to improve the recall for the churn class."

    "The results of this analysis give PT Telco a very clear picture of where churn is coming from and how the company can respond. The model highlights specific high risk groups especially month to month customers, users with short tenure, customers paying higher monthly charges, and those who don’t subscribe to add on services like OnlineSecurity or TechSupport. These insights allow PT Telco to focus its retention efforts more efficiently, targeting the customers who genuinely need attention instead of spreading marketing resources too broadly. The strong influence of contract type suggests that promoting contract upgrades or bundled long term plans could significantly reduce churn. Short tenure customers also emerge as a vulnerable group, meaning early stage onboarding and support programs can help prevent new customers from leaving too quickly. Higher monthly charges being linked to churn indicates that pricing adjustments, flexible plans, or value added bundles may help retain price-sensitive users. Meanwhile, since users with more add on services tend to stay, the company can encourage service bundling to increase customer stickiness. Overall, the LightGBM model offers a reliable way to identify at risk customers, helping PT Telco reduce churn more strategically, lower retention costs, and maximize customer lifetime value."

    "Based on the results of this project, several actions can help PT Telco effectively reduce customer churn. Since contract type is the strongest factor, the company should prioritize encouraging month to month customers to switch to longer term contracts by offering discounts, loyalty points, or bundled deals. This is the segment with the highest churn risk, so even a small improvement here can significantly reduce churn rates. For customers with short tenure another highly vulnerable group PT Telco should strengthen early engagement strategies such as onboarding support, welcome offers, or personalized check ins during the first 3 6 months. These early touches help build loyalty before customers start considering switching.\n",
    "Because higher monthly charges are linked to higher churn, it’s also recommended to revisit the pricing strategy. PT Telco could offer flexible plans, usage based billing, or targeted price adjustments for high paying customers who show signs of dissatisfaction. The analysis also shows that customers with add on services like OnlineSecurity, TechSupport, and OnlineBackup churn much less, so the company should actively promote these services through free trials or discounted bundles to boost retention.\n",
    "Finally, the LightGBM model can be deployed as an early-warning system, allowing PT Telco to focus retention efforts on the customers most likely to churn instead of treating all customers equally. This targeted approach reduces unnecessary marketing spend and helps teams reach the right customers at the right time. By combining contract optimization, early engagement, pricing adjustments, and service bundling with a data driven churn prediction system, PT Telco can significantly improve customer loyalty and long-term revenue stability."

    "This project successfully identifies the key drivers of customer churn at PT Telco and builds a strong predictive model using LightGBM to detect at-risk customers. The analysis shows that contract type, tenure, and monthly charges are the most influential factors, supported by patterns found in the exploratory data analysis. Service-related features like OnlineSecurity, TechSupport, and OnlineBackup also play an important role in stabilizing customer retention. With these insights and the churn prediction model, PT Telco can implement more targeted and cost-efficient retention strategies to reduce churn, improve customer satisfaction, and increase long-term customer lifetime value."
